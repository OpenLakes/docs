# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: July 2024_

This Privacy Policy explains how OpenLakes ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and safeguards the information that passes through https://openlakes.io or any documentation, downloads, or trial experiences hosted on this site (collectively, the "Services").

## Information We Collect

- **Information you provide.** When you subscribe to updates, request support, or otherwise contact us, we collect the information you choose to share (such as your name, email address, or organization).
- **Usage information.** We may collect non-identifying technical data (such as browser type, referring pages, and time spent on the site) that helps us understand how visitors use the Services.
- **Community contributions.** If you interact with our open source repositories (for example, on GitHub), the information you publish there remains subject to the policies of those third-party platforms.

## How We Use Information

We use collected information to:

- provide, maintain, and improve the Services;
- respond to your questions, feedback, or requests;
- monitor usage trends and protect the Services against misuse; and
- comply with any legal obligations that apply to us.

We do not sell or rent personal information. Limited sharing may occur with service providers (for example, hosting and analytics partners) who support our operations, and they only receive the data necessary to assist us.

## Cookies and Analytics

We may use cookies or similar technologies to keep the Services functioning and to understand aggregate usage. You can usually set your browser to refuse cookies, although doing so may limit features.

## Data Retention and Security

We keep personal information only for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes described above or as required by law. While we take reasonable steps to protect information, no online service can guarantee absolute security, so you use the Services at your own risk.

## Third-Party Links

The Services may link to documentation, binaries, or community resources hosted elsewhere. Those services have their own privacy policies; we are not responsible for the content or practices of third parties.

## Children

The Services are not directed to children under 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us data, contact us and we will promptly remove it.

## Your Choices

You may request updates to or deletion of your personal information by contacting us. Depending on your location, you may have additional rights under applicable laws, and we will honor those requests where required.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Last updated" date above and, if appropriate, provide additional notice.
