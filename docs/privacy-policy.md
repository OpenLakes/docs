# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: December 2025_

This Privacy Policy explains how OpenLakes LLC, a Texas limited liability company ("OpenLakes," "we," "us," or "our"), collects, uses, and handles information in connection with https://openlakes.io, https://docs.openlakes.io, and any documentation, downloads, or trial experiences hosted on these sites (collectively, the "Services").

!!! warning "Important Privacy Disclaimer"
    **We cannot guarantee full privacy or complete data protection.** While we implement reasonable measures, no system is fully secure. You use the Services and any OpenLakes software at your own risk. See the "No Guarantee of Privacy" section below for details.

## Scope of This Policy

This Privacy Policy applies only to the **OpenLakes website and documentation Services**. If you deploy OpenLakes software in your own environment, **you are solely responsible** for the privacy and security of all data processed by your deployment. We have no access to, control over, or responsibility for data in user-deployed instances.

## Information We Collect

- **Information you provide.** When you subscribe to updates, request support, or otherwise contact us, we collect the information you choose to share (such as your name, email address, or organization).
- **Usage information.** We may collect non-identifying technical data (such as browser type, referring pages, and time spent on the site) that helps us understand how visitors use the Services.
- **Community contributions.** If you interact with our open source repositories (for example, on GitHub), the information you publish there remains subject to the policies of those third-party platforms.

## How We Use Information

We use collected information to:

- provide, maintain, and improve the Services;
- respond to your questions, feedback, or requests;
- monitor usage trends and protect the Services against misuse; and
- comply with any legal obligations that apply to us.

We do not sell or rent personal information. Limited sharing may occur with service providers (for example, hosting and analytics partners) who support our operations, and they only receive the data necessary to assist us.

## Cookies and Analytics

We may use cookies or similar technologies to keep the Services functioning and to understand aggregate usage. You can usually set your browser to refuse cookies, although doing so may limit features.

## No Guarantee of Privacy

**WE CANNOT AND DO NOT GUARANTEE FULL PRIVACY OR COMPLETE DATA PROTECTION.** You acknowledge and agree that:

- No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure;
- We cannot guarantee that unauthorized parties will never access your information;
- Security vulnerabilities may exist in our systems, third-party components, or open source dependencies;
- Information transmitted over the internet may be intercepted by third parties;
- We may be required to disclose information in response to legal process; and
- Technical failures, human error, or malicious actors could compromise data security.

**YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.**

## No Guarantee Against Data Loss

**WE DO NOT GUARANTEE AGAINST DATA LOSS.** Data transmitted to or stored by the Services may be lost, corrupted, or become inaccessible due to:

- System failures or outages;
- Software bugs or errors;
- Security incidents;
- Human error;
- Third-party service failures; or
- Other causes beyond our control.

You are solely responsible for maintaining backups of any important data. We accept no liability for any data loss.

## User-Deployed OpenLakes Instances

If you deploy OpenLakes software in your own environment:

- **You are the data controller** for all data processed by your deployment;
- **We have no access** to your deployment or the data within it;
- **You are solely responsible** for implementing appropriate privacy and security measures;
- **You must comply** with all applicable privacy laws and regulations; and
- **This Privacy Policy does not apply** to data processed by your deployment.

## Third-Party Components

OpenLakes software incorporates numerous third-party open source components (Apache Spark, Trino, Kafka, MinIO, etc.). Each component has its own security characteristics and potential vulnerabilities. We make no representations about the privacy or security practices of third-party components.

## Third-Party Links

The Services may link to documentation, binaries, or community resources hosted elsewhere. Those services have their own privacy policies; we are not responsible for the content or practices of third parties.

## Data Retention and Security

We keep personal information only for as long as necessary to achieve the purposes described above or as required by law. While we take reasonable steps to protect information, **no online service can guarantee absolute security**, so you use the Services at your own risk.

## Children

The Services are not directed to children under 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us data, contact us and we will promptly remove it.

## Your Choices

You may request updates to or deletion of your personal information by contacting us. Depending on your location, you may have additional rights under applicable laws, and we will honor those requests where required.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Last updated" date above and, if appropriate, provide additional notice.
